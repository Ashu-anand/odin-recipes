    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Step 1 </strong> </li>
        Gather all ingredients.

        <li> <strong> Step 2 </strong> </li>
        Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.

        <li> <strong> Step 3 </strong> </li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
        
        <li> <strong> Step 4 </strong> </li>
        Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.
